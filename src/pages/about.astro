        <h1>About Nelly’s Adventures</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Nelly’s Adventures</strong> is an outdoor child-minding service based in <strong>Manly</strong> for children aged <strong>2–5</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a small group size and a focus on nature play, each day is designed to be calm, engaging, and full of wonder. Whether it’s discovering bugs, building with sticks, or simply listening to the wind in the trees, children are encouraged to explore at their own pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>More than just care</strong> — this is a space for connection, curiosity, and confident growth.
