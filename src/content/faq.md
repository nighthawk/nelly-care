# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this a 5 days a week service?
The service usually runs Mondays - Wednesdays, 8:30am - 4pm. Additional times/days possible on request.

## When and where is drop-off/pick-up?
We usually meet at Little Manly Point Playground in Manly. Ideally children would be dropped off 8:30-9am, and picked up 3:30-4pm; however individual arrangements can be made.

## Why are you mostly outdoors?
Spending time in nature allows children to explore, play, and learn in an environment that supports their physical, emotional, and cognitive development. Outdoor settings provide endless opportunities for curiosity, creativity, and discovery. Children will experience greater physical health, emotional well-being, social skills and a deeper connection with nature.

## What does a typical day look like?
Our day includes:
- Regular meals, group times.
- Travel between locations (playgrounds, parks, beaches).
- Lots of opportunity for free play.
- Nature walks, outdoor activities, and hands-on exploration.
- Planned and spontaneous learning.
- Fun and adventure, quiet times and rest.
The routine may vary depending on the children’s interests and weather conditions.
​
## What happens if it rains?
In light rain, our plans go ahead; all children should bring rain jackets, pants and boots if rain is forecast.

​I have plenty of options for days or times when the weather is unsuitable for outdoor activities (e.g., heavy rain, extreme heat), these include museums, libraries and other indoor venues.

In the unlikely event that conditions are considered too dangerous to continue the service, activities will be cancelled and carers notified to pick up their children early.
​
## ​Where do you take the children?
We visit local parks, playgrounds, and other public spaces in and around Manly, NSW. The destinations depend on the day’s activities and weather, and the children's interests.
​
## How do I know my child will be safe?
Safety is my top priority:
- I maintain close supervision and adhere to minimum child ratio requirements.
- Children wear high-visibility vests and trackers (with parental consent).
- I carry a fully stocked first aid kit and am trained in First Aid, CPR, Asthma and Anaphylaxis Management.
- I also hold a current Working with Children Check and Police Check.
- Policies and procedures are in place, including to ensure safety during travel between locations.
