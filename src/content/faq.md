# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this a 5 days a week service?
The service runs Mondays - Wednesdays, 8:30am - 4pm.

## When and where is drop-off/pick-up?
Currently we meet at Little Manly Point Playground in Manly. Ideally children would be dropped off 8:30-9am, and picked up 3:30-4pm; however individual arrangements can be made.

## Why are you mostly outdoors?
Spending time in nature allows children to explore, play, and learn in an environment that supports their physical, emotional, and cognitive development. Outdoor settings provide endless opportunities for curiosity, creativity, and discovery. Children will experience greater physical health, emotional well-being, social skills and a deeper connection with nature.

## What does a typical day look like?
Our day includes:
- Drop-off and free play at a local playground.
- Morning circle with snack and songs.
- Travel to destination for the day.
- Nature walks, outdoor activities, and hands-on exploration.
- Lunch, quiet time, and engaging play.
- Travel back, then free play until pick up.
The routine may vary depending on the children’s interests and weather conditions.
​
## What happens if it rains?
In light rain, our plans go ahead; all children should have rain jackets, pants and boots.

​I have plenty of options for days or times when the weather is unsuitable for outdoor activities (e.g., heavy rain, extreme heat), these include museums, libraries and other indoor venues.

In the unlikely event that conditions are considered too dangerous to continue the service, activities will be cancelled and carers notified.
​
## ​Where do you take the children?
We visit local parks, playgrounds, and other public spaces in and around Manly, NSW. The destinations depend on the day’s activities and weather, and the children's interests.
​
## How do I know my child will be safe?
Safety is my top priority:
- Children wear high-visibility vests and trackers (with parental consent).
- I maintain a 1:4 ratio for close supervision.
- I carry a fully stocked first aid kit and am trained in First Aid, CPR, Asthma and Anaphylaxis Management. I also hold a current Working with Children Check and Police Check.
- For moving between places, the children walk using a walking rope, or are seated in a 4-seater pram with seatbelts. We might also use public transport (buses, ferries) depending on the location we visit; policies and procedures are in place to ensure safety during travel.
- In addition, I share daily updates and photos through a private WhatsApp group. Individual communication is also available for any specific concerns or questions.
​
## ​How do I book a spot?
Spots are limited, so early bookings are recommended! Contact me to inquire about availability and reserve a place for your child.

## ​Is there an orientation period?
Yes, it is recommended that each child that is signing up to attend regularly has at least one orientation day before starting at the service. A parent/carer will be attending the service with the child during the orientation visit.
