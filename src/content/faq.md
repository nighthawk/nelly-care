## What does a typical day look like?

Each day includes:  
- Group time, shared meals  
- Travel to parks, beaches, or playgrounds  
- Plenty of free play, discovery, and nature walks  
- Rest or quiet time  
- Spontaneous and planned learning experiences  
- A gentle rhythm with room for flexibility

## What if it rains?

We go ahead in light rain â€” children should bring wet-weather gear (rain jackets, pants, and boots).  

If the weather is too severe (e.g. storms or extreme heat), we may:  
- Move to indoor venues like libraries or museums  
- End the day early if necessary â€” parents/carers will be notified

## Where do you go each day?

We explore a mix of local parks, beaches, playgrounds, and nature spots around Manly and surrounding suburbs.  
Destinations vary depending on the day, weather, and childrenâ€™s interests.

## How is my child kept safe?

Safety is always the priority at Nellyâ€™s Adventures:  
- Maximum of 5 children per day for close supervision  
- High-vis vests and AirTags (with parental/carer consent) are used for busy areas  
- I carry a fully stocked first aid kit at all times  
- I hold current First Aid, CPR, Asthma and Anaphylaxis Training, plus a Working with Children Check and Police Check as well as a Child Protection Awareness Certificate  
- Clear safety procedures for travel, emergencies, and communication
